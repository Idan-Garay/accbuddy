attribute1:
Yahoo Accounts
Facebook Markeplace
Google Accounts
Twitter Accounts
Hotmail Accounts
Google Voice Accounts
Facebook Accounts

attribute2:
hot, sale, new


when user opens website:
"all accounts" selected in attribute1 menu, so it orange.
nothing selected in hot, sale, new so all buttons are same height.


user may click on any of attr1, to select items from catalog, then attribute becomes orange
user may click on any attr2, to select items from catalog, then attribute goes up
user may select attr1 and attr2 at same time
to cancel selection of attr1 or attr2 click "all accounts"  in attr1 menu.

search menu: searchs by  product name ( provider in figma)
use dynamic search, for example user enter letter m, then only items with m left in catalog, if he enters ma, then only items with ma left, etc
for example if user enters mail.ru, we show him 3 items mailru, mail.ru mix and  mail.ru biz ( as on figma design)
while attr1 or attr2 activated, the search menu will choose between activated items


attr1 and attr2 we include in database with items. So each item has value attr1 and attr2. 
when user opens website first time, you request database:
item quantity
item price 
attr1
attr2
store all info received locally. in IndexedDB? or local storage?

when user refresh webpage and u have data stored locally, you request database for updated items ( with timestamp of ur last local update)
and 
    if database has some updated items it will return it, so u update locally and show customer
    else just show customer from local storage
